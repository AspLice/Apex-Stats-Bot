# Apex Stats Bot

This bot was developed as an easy way to show off user stats for Apex Legends.

The bot currently has the following features:

- User Stats
- `>>stats platform username` will show account and battle pass levels, as well as kills, damage, and seasons wins, and the current 3 selected trackers.
- Most recent news article
- Server Status (soon)
- Some fun server easter eggs ;)
